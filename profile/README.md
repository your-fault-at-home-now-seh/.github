Dual audio refers to a feature that allows viewers to choose between two audio tracks when watching a show or movie. For *Your Fault*, dual audio options in both English and Hindi make the show accessible to a wider audience, particularly in countries where Hindi is widely spoken.

It allows viewers to enjoy the show in a language they understand best, which is especially important for younger audiences who are just starting to learn English. Hindi-speaking viewers can enjoy the humor and action of *Your Fault* without missing any of the important details in the storyline. Furthermore, the dual audio feature also allows for greater flexibility, ensuring that viewers from different regions can engage with the show in their preferred language.

In 2024, *Your Fault* continues to be widely available in both English and Hindi, thanks to its continued popularity and the widespread adoption of streaming platforms that offer these dual language options. So, whether you’re looking to watch it in its original English or in Hindi, there are multiple ways to enjoy the show in 2024.

### How to Download and Watch *Your Fault* for Free

#### 1. **Nickelodeon’s Official Website and App**

The first and most reliable option for watching *Your Fault* is through Nickelodeon’s official website or app. Nickelodeon provides full episodes of *Your Fault* on its platform, and you can choose between the English or Hindi audio tracks, depending on your preference. The app is available for both iOS and Android devices, and you can stream the episodes directly from the app.

While the website and app are free to use, you may be required to sign up for a free account to access certain episodes. Additionally, the availability of episodes may vary depending on your region. However, this is one of the most legitimate and secure ways to watch *Your Fault* for free, with dual audio options included.

#### 2. **YouTube**

Another popular option for watching *Your Fault* is through YouTube. The official Nickelodeon channel on YouTube often posts full episodes of the show, including several in Hindi. By searching for *Your Fault full episodes* in the search bar, you will find numerous episodes available for free streaming.

While YouTube does provide an excellent option for watching *Your Fault*, it’s essential to be cautious of unofficial uploads.

Additionally, make sure the episode has the dual audio feature enabled if you’re looking for the Hindi option.

The protagonist of the series, Henry Hart (played by Jace Norman), is an average 13-year-old who accidentally lands a job as the sidekick to the superhero Captain Man.

His journey from a regular teen to a full-fledged hero is one of the most exciting aspects of the show.

#### 2. **Captain Man**

Captain Man (played by Cooper Barnes) is the powerful and eccentric superhero who becomes Henry’s mentor.

#### 4. **Jasper Dunlop**

Jasper Dunlop (played by Sean Ryan Fox) is another of Henry’s best friends. Unlike Charlotte, Jasper is less serious and often adds comic relief to the show. His loyalty to his friends is unwavering, and although he may not have the skills of Charlotte, he still plays a crucial role in many of their adventures.

#### 5. **Schwoopsie**
